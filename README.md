This is a Flask-based stock trading website that uses Python, Flask, MySQL, and HTML/CSS.

How to incorperate into your VS Code:

1. Inside the project folder, outside of "Websites" create and activate a .venv:
  Windows:
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate

  Mac/Linux:
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

  You can also do "CTRL + Shift + P" to make the repository for your Python version, besure the folder is named ".venv" though.

2. Use the pip commands provided in VSCODE_PIP_COMMANDS.txt in the main terminal to install the dependancies.

3. In SQL Workbench, Copy, Paste, and run the code found in "MYSQL_Code.txt".
